# troposphericModel

Project Introduction: 
This project aims to computationally solve a set of differential equations in order to characterize a simplified model of tropospheric chemistry. While the atmosphere is made up of many complex chemical and thermodynamic systems, we are solely focusing on the chemical reactions in this model. Looking at the chemical reactions helps us to understand the “underlying dynamic structure” and conditions for the chemical system in the atmosphere (Field et. al). In following the Field et. al paper “Characterization of oscillation and a period-doubling transition to chaos reflecting dynamic instability in a simplified model of tropospheric chemistry” and Professor Sarah Kavassalis’ paper “Consequences of nonlinear dynamics in tropospheric photochemistry”, we observe different characteristics of the model based on different initial conditions including unstable steady states, oscillations, predictability, and deterministic chaos. In characterizing this simplified model, we aim to learn about chemical interactions that predict the composition of our tropospheric system. Notably, the ipynb file walks through different behaviours of the system while the .py file creates an animation for [CO] vs. [OH] phase plot. 

I wrote a majority of the ipynb and py files. The initial solver cell in the ipynb file was created by Prof Kavassalis (as specified in the program). Additionally, Prof Kavassalis provided some assistance in writing a few lines of the bifurcation code in the ipynb file. These sections are noted using in-line comments. However, I did write a vast majority of the ipynb file and class that interfaces with it.
